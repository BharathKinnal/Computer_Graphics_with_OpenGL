# Computer Graphics with OpenGL

**Abstract:**

OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) is a C/C++ library that can be used for major animations and in **Computer Graphics**.
Our aim is to implement a simple application that draws a Shape of your choice (from the given shapes), say ellipse. Now, you will be able to drag it, Color it and Rotate it.
The programs will be implemented using **CodeBlocks** IDE and **GL**, **GLU**, **GLUT** headers.
